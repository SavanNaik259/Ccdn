# Fix CDN Bandwidth Testing on Deployed Site

## The Problem
Your CDN bandwidth test loader shows "Failed to fetch" on your deployed Netlify site because Firebase Admin SDK environment variables are missing.

## Quick Solution Steps

### Step 1: Configure Netlify Environment Variables
Go to your Netlify dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=auric-a0c92
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=[your-firebase-service-account-email]
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=[your-firebase-private-key]
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=[your-private-key-id]
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=[your-client-id]
FIREBASE_CERT_URL=[your-cert-url]
```

### Step 2: Upload Test Products
1. Open `cdn-bandwidth-test-uploader.html` on your deployed site
2. Add products to categories: bandwidth-test-1, bandwidth-test-2, bandwidth-test-3
3. Each upload will save to Firebase Storage in the correct format

### Step 3: Test CDN Behavior
1. Open `cdn-bandwidth-test-loader.html` on your deployed site
2. Click "Load Test Category 1/2/3"
3. Watch response times to see CDN caching behavior

## What You'll See
- First load per category: Slower (downloads from Firebase)
- Subsequent loads: Faster (served from CDN cache)
- Firebase Console bandwidth only increases on first regional access

## Expected File Structure in Firebase Storage
```
bandwidthTest/
├── bandwidth-test-1-products.json
├── bandwidth-test-2-products.json
├── bandwidth-test-3-products.json
└── productImages/
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── image3.jpg
```

## How CDN Optimization Works
1. First visitor downloads from Firebase Storage (bandwidth counted)
2. Firebase Storage CDN caches files globally
3. Subsequent visitors get cached files (no bandwidth counted)
4. Only updated files trigger new downloads

## Test Results You Should See
- Response times: Varying based on CDN cache status
- Data sizes: ~2-5KB for JSON, ~50-200KB for images
- Cache status: "Hit" for cached content, "Miss" for new downloads
- Firebase bandwidth: Only increases for cache misses

## If Environment Variables Not Available
The bandwidth testing will only work locally with sample data until Firebase Admin SDK is properly configured on Netlify.
